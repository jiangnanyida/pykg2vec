vul_153	has_cve_id	cve-2017-13082
vul_153	intruded_by	key reinstallation attacks (“krack”) work against the four-way handshake of the wpa2 protocol. krack takes advantage of the retransmission of a handshake message to prompt the installation of the same encryption key every time it receives message 3 from the access point. retransmission of the handshake message from the access point occurs if a proper client acknowledgement is not received to the initial message; retransmission resets the nonce value and replay counter to their initial values. a malicious actor could force these nonce resets by replaying the appropriate handshake message, which could allow for injection and decryption of arbitrary packets, hijacking of tcp connections, injection of http content, or replaying of unicast or multicast data frames on the targeted device.

vul_155	intruded_by	the micom s1 studio software does not limit user access to its installed executables to only authenticated administrative users. a malicious user with any level of access to the local system could replace executables within the micom s1 studio program files directory with malicious files. when the micom s1 studio application is run, the malicious executable would be run instead. successful exploitation of this vulnerability could cause loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality with the local system and a disruption in communications with other connected devices.in addition, a windows service running under localsystem is located within this directory as well. replacing the associated executable, in this case, would allow lower privileged users to escalate their privileges to an administrator level on the system.
