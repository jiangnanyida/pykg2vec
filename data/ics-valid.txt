vul_79	has_cve_id	cve-2013-0681
vul_79	intruded_by	the datahub application accepts formatted text commands via a tcp connection on ports 4502/ tcp and 4503/tcp. these commands are parsed, validated, and executed within the application. the parser contains an error where malformed input will cause the parser to perform a reference through a null pointer, causing the application to crash.
